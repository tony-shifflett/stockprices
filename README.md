# iStocks

This project is an elaboration one of a homework assignment in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immsersive program. 

## Development

iStocks was built using create-react-app. This frontend app connects to a backend application hosted on [heroku](https://istocks-backend.herokuapp.com/). The backend repository is [here](https://github.com/tony-shifflett/istocks-backend). 

## Libraries
The primary functionality of iStocks is the dislay of daily price trends for the selected stock. That's done using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). The specific code to acheive this was found via a third party resource cited in the codebase. 

(Redux Toolkit)[https://redux-toolkit.js.org/] has been integrated for state management across the app, with the goal of utilizing it to manage data for future elaborations.
